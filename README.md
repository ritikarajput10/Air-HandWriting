# Air-HandWriting

Developed a real‑time “air handwriting” interface using OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand landmarks and translate gestures into keyboard input.

Integrated custom mapping algorithms to convert 3D hand coordinates into alphanumeric characters with >90% recognition accuracy.

Optimized pipeline for sub‑100 ms latency, ensuring smooth, low‑lag user interaction.

Packaged solution as a Python application with a simple GUI for plug‑and‑play deployment.
